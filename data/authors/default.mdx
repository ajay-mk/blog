I am a third-year graduate student in the [Valeev Research Group](https://valeevgroup.github.io/) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu). I am also work as a C++ developer focused on scientific computing software.

My research interests lie at the intersection of quantum chemistry, symbolic algebra, and high-performance computing. Specifically, I work on:

- Developing higher-order coupled-cluster methods for accurate ground and excited state properties  
- Automating many-body quantum chemistry methods using symbolic algebra for tensors and second-quantized operators  
- Designing high-performance, scalable implementations for quantum chemical computations

In this blog, I share my development journeyâ€”highlighting interesting problems, challenges, and hurdles I encounter along the way.
